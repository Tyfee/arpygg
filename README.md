Arpygg is a extremely simple arpeggiator writen in python on top of the mido library.

It allows you to send pre programmed sets of notes through a virtual midi port to your DAW of choice. You can also adjust the velocity of the notes and the duration of the delay between them. 

The GUI was completely written in Tkinter, allowing the program to be executed in both Windows and Linux platforms. Download the source code or the installer and start using it!

--- IMPORTANT ---
Due to rtmidi limitations, in windows systems, it is necessary to install a third party for virtual ports, i recommend loopMIDI.
